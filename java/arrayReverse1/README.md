## Approach & Efficiency

I used a for loop approach to solve this problem, not only this approach is simple but also it is the best approach for a vanilla array object.
 increase the readability of the code and to improve the maintainability of the code since all three major parts of a loop i.e. initialization, increment / decrement and test condition are written at the same line(in most cases).
